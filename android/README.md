# TensorFlow Lite Audio Classification Android Demo

This is a "fork" of https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/android/tutorials/audio_classification
You can see the original code here https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/0bbf4fe43fbf41b7174b9ce4a64d69bd33aadd21/lite/examples/audio_classification/android
The main difference of this code is that it adds the option to use the "birds" model (you can see the code changes on [2665b5e](https://github.com/ghashi/tensor-flow-lite-task-audio-poc/commit/2665b5e9d94a73ce6b23108ea8b21d4f67b854d4))
